is a great boon to your development process.

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **main** branch
2. Run `yarn --immutable` ([install](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
3. Code your heart out!
4. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/Naval-Base/yuudachi/compare) (Make sure you follow the [conventional commit format](https://github.com/Naval-Base/yuudachi/blob/main/.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md))
